                UV exposure is a known risk factor for melanoma. Geographic location is known to influence UV 
                  exposure and the distribution of the incidence of melanoma. 
                 <br><br>
                 Cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer in the USA 
                 <br>
                 An important feature of melanoma is that the incidence rate is highest in lighter skinned patients and is much rarer in darker skinned individuals. Furthermore, melanoma is one of the most deadly skin cancers; one person dies every hour from melanoma in the USA.
                 <br>
                 It is estimated that the annual increase in the incidence rate of melanoma has been approximately 3–7% per year worldwide for Caucasians 
                 <br><br>
                 Prompted by key points from the IARC’s report – such as an increase in basal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas and ocular melanomas among tanning bed users, and a 75% increase in cutaneous melanoma risk among those who started tanning before age 30 years – nations across Northern Europe, Australia, New Zealand, North America and even Brazil have sought legislation to restrict tanning bed use, especially among young people.
                 <br><br>
                 Results from a large, population-based cancer registry (n = 3772) and treatment unit data sets (n = 1300) in Australia independently showed that the time from detection of a change in the skin (first noticing a suspicious spot) to diagnosis was not longer in those who had thick lesions compared with those who had thin melanomas
                 <br><br>
                 Analysis of patients from the Queensland (Australia) cancer registry revealed that head and neck melanoma patients were more likely than patients with trunk melanomas to have higher levels of occupational sun exposure but lower levels of recreational sun exposure
                 <br>
                 The trunk and face were the predominant areas for lesions in the Canadian patients and the lower limbs were the most common sites in the New Zealand patients
                 <br>
                 <br><br>
                 A continent wise breakdown:<br><br>
                 Africa<br><br>
                 Melanoma is extremely rare among black populations in Africa and most cases of melanoma tend to be of the acral lentiginous subtype 
                 <br>
                 Africans have greater levels of melanin than Caucasians which provide protection from the carcinogenic effects of solar radiation
                 <br><br>
                 Asia<br><br>
                 According to findings in the USA and Europe, thickness was the most important prognostic factor in predicting survival in the melanoma patient in this Japanese study, with the best cut-off point being 4 or 5 mm.
                 <br><br>
                 Australia<br><br>
                 Australia has among the highest incidence rates of melanoma in the world. Incidence rates trend toward a south–north gradient within the eastern states of Australia. In Queensland over a 20-year time period (1982–2002), incidence rates were highest for the trunk followed by the upper limbs in males, and the lower limbs followed by the upper limbs and trunk for females<br>
                 <br>
                 Europe<br><br>
                 Truncal melanomas predominated as the most prevalent site of lesions for both the north and south Norway, and this did not change over the years studied
                 <br>
                 In France, a retrospective study of melanomas diagnosed between 1980 and 2004 found a steady increase in thin melanomas predominantly on the trunk in men
                 <br>
                 Regional cancer registries throughout Italy, particularly in the northern region of the country, collect epidemiologic figures and clinical characteristics of malignant melanoma. Similar to other countries in Europe and throughout the world, the trunk and lower limbs appear to be the most frequent sites of melanomas
                 <br><br>
                 South America<br><br>
                 There was predominance for melanomas on the limbs in women; conversely, a higher number of melanomas were found on the backs of the hands, soles of the feet and ears in men. The authors attribute the majority of this observed difference to genetic composition, as well as a contribution from sun exposure patterns
                 <br>
                 The trunk and feet were the most predominant sites for lesions in both males and females.
                 <br><br>
                 Middle East<br><br>
                 Males were 1.5-times more likely to have melanoma than females. The gender difference was speculated to be due to clothing and body covering customs, as well as lower levels of employment outside the home for women.
                 <br><br>
                 United States of America<br><br>
                 Using 11 US cancer registries, Eide and Weinstock examined the association between UV index, latitude and melanoma incidence. They found that higher UV indices were significantly associated with an increase in melanoma incidence and lower latitude had significant correlation with incidence of melanoma in non-Hispanic whites only. Melanoma incidence was not significantly associated with index in black, Hispanic, Asian/pacific islander and Native American populations.
                 <br>
                 A study of ethnic differences among melanoma patients revealed a 1.96–3.01-fold greater risk of disease-specific mortality in minorities compared with white populations
